## 👋 Hello, I’m @myroqs

I'm a finance professional with over a decade of experience specializing in supporting Supply Chain businesses. Currently, I'm diving into the world of data analytics by pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics, aiming to leverage data science to provide deeper insights and strategic guidance to management teams.

📊 As part of my journey into data science, I'm actively learning Python and R to broaden my analytical toolkit and unlock new possibilities for business optimization and decision-making.

🔍 Most of the projects you'll find here are portfolios submitted during my data science coursework. They reflect my journey in this course and how my data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling is evolving.

🎸 Outside of crunching numbers and coding, you can find me reading self help books or strumming away on my guitar, unwinding and finding creative inspiration.
